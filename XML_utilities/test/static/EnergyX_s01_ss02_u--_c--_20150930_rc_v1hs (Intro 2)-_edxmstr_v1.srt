00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:03,900
Turning from these abstract
goals, here is a short run-through

1
00:00:03,900 --> 00:00:05,510
of the course content.

2
00:00:05,510 --> 00:00:09,800
First, energy system overview--
the flows and transformations

3
00:00:09,800 --> 00:00:13,670
of energy in the economy,
both in the US and the world,

4
00:00:13,670 --> 00:00:18,160
and a look at how the energy system has
changed over the last few centuries.

5
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:23,080
Second, calculating costs-- how to go
from a system's capital and operating

6
00:00:23,080 --> 00:00:26,130
costs to the cost of the
product, say from the price

7
00:00:26,130 --> 00:00:31,230
of a car, fuel, and insurance to the
average cost per kilometer you drive--

8
00:00:31,230 --> 00:00:35,270
and how to calculate the cost of
reducing environmental harms--

9
00:00:35,270 --> 00:00:39,460
say the cost of cutting carbon emissions
by buying a solar power system.

10
00:00:39,460 --> 00:00:43,500
Third, environmental impacts-- air
pollution, climate change, land

11
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:46,380
use-- an introduction to
the science into the methods

12
00:00:46,380 --> 00:00:48,310
for estimating impacts.

13
00:00:48,310 --> 00:00:52,320
Fourth, two short but crucial
topics-- the abundance

14
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:56,190
of fossil fuels and a quick
introduction into the electricity grid.

15
00:00:56,190 --> 00:00:59,730
Fifth, solar photovoltaic
power-- the physics

16
00:00:59,730 --> 00:01:02,680
of how it works, how the
cost of a complete system

17
00:01:02,680 --> 00:01:08,820
is built up from various components, how
and why costs have decreased over time.

18
00:01:08,820 --> 00:01:11,460
Sixth, nuclear power-- the physics of how

19
00:01:11,460 --> 00:01:13,870
it works, how the cost of a complete system

20
00:01:13,870 --> 00:01:18,540
is built up from various components,
how and why costs have mostly

21
00:01:18,540 --> 00:01:21,040
increased over time.

22
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:24,710
Seventh, energy efficiency and demand-- how

23
00:01:24,710 --> 00:01:27,960
has the energy efficiency of some
important energy transformations

24
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:30,110
changed over the last century?

25
00:01:30,110 --> 00:01:34,880
Why have we seen stunning improvements
in some cases and stagnation in others?

26
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:38,040
When do improvements in
energy efficiency cut demand,

27
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:40,140
and when do they increase it?

28
00:01:40,140 --> 00:01:43,280
And finally, eighth, an
attempt at a synthesis.

29
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:48,190
What does this blizzard of facts mean
for the big energy system challenges?

30
00:01:48,190 --> 00:01:51,500
This is a minimal intro,
not a comprehensive course.

31
00:01:51,500 --> 00:01:53,350
Here are just some of the important topics

32
00:01:53,350 --> 00:01:57,240
we have left out-- a deep
dive into fossil fuels, more

33
00:01:57,240 --> 00:02:00,390
detail on the electric power grid--
perhaps the greatest engineering

34
00:02:00,390 --> 00:02:04,400
achievement of the 20th century--
energy end uses such as transportation,

35
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:09,090
buildings, and industry, other energy
sources, such as wind, biofuels, fossil

36
00:02:09,090 --> 00:02:12,140
fuels with carbon capture,
and hydropower, and finally,

37
00:02:12,140 --> 00:02:13,950
electricity storage.

38
00:02:13,950 --> 00:02:17,460
Finally, here are a few
guidelines and a warning about how

39
00:02:17,460 --> 00:02:19,730
we will approach these topics.

40
00:02:19,730 --> 00:02:23,510
First, we take a how-things-work,
descriptive approach in the hope

41
00:02:23,510 --> 00:02:26,390
that you can gain a rough
mechanic's appreciation

42
00:02:26,390 --> 00:02:29,790
for how a few key parts
of the energy system work.

43
00:02:29,790 --> 00:02:33,400
How does a gas turbine work,
from compressor to combustion?

44
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:35,980
How are turbine blades made and assembled.

45
00:02:35,980 --> 00:02:39,220
Detail rich, not theory rich-- our goal here

46
00:02:39,220 --> 00:02:42,960
is to give you a sense of the
interplay of technology and design

47
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:45,750
that shapes important energy devices.

48
00:02:45,750 --> 00:02:49,510
We want you to understand that no
energy technology stands alone.

49
00:02:49,510 --> 00:02:53,570
Each is interwoven with a larger set
of technologies and supply chains.

50
00:02:53,570 --> 00:02:56,920
And the goal of learning all of this
is to help you develop intuitions about

51
00:02:56,920 --> 00:03:00,700
when innovation is easy,
and when it will be hard.

52
00:03:00,700 --> 00:03:02,390
This course is opinionated.

53
00:03:02,390 --> 00:03:03,780
That's the warning.

54
00:03:03,780 --> 00:03:06,270
Energy is too messy and
too political to admit

55
00:03:06,270 --> 00:03:09,260
the objective, value-neutral
presentation that might

56
00:03:09,260 --> 00:03:11,810
work in an Introductory Physics course.

57
00:03:11,810 --> 00:03:14,510
So we will let you hear our sharp judgments,

58
00:03:14,510 --> 00:03:16,670
but we will provide clear flags about where

59
00:03:16,670 --> 00:03:19,040
our judgment diverges from the mainstream,

60
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:21,280
and give you links to alternate opinions.

61
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:23,980
For example, we are more
optimistic than many

62
00:03:23,980 --> 00:03:28,970
that nuclear power can provide a
high-intensity, environmentally benign

63
00:03:28,970 --> 00:03:31,385
energy source for the 21st century.

64
00:03:31,385 --> 00:03:33,760
But we will provide you with
an overview of the arguments

65
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:36,450
that nuclear power is too
expensive or dangerous,

66
00:03:36,450 --> 00:03:40,160
and we'll give you pointers to sources
that make these arguments effectively.

67
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:42,100
We aim at misconceptions.

68
00:03:42,100 --> 00:03:45,310
We don't want to waste your time
teaching you what you already know.

69
00:03:45,310 --> 00:03:49,130
We will select material to aim at
based on known, common misconceptions

70
00:03:49,130 --> 00:03:50,670
about the energy system.

71
00:03:50,670 --> 00:03:52,470
And where possible, we will use the testing

72
00:03:52,470 --> 00:03:56,500
in this course to understand
what common misconceptions are.

73
00:03:56,500 --> 00:03:59,960
This course is driven by the
view that economics matters.

74
00:03:59,960 --> 00:04:03,530
Some energy courses, particularly
those taught by physicists like me,

75
00:04:03,530 --> 00:04:06,630
tend to focus on fundamental
technical feasibility

76
00:04:06,630 --> 00:04:09,740
or on marvelous new technologies,
without paying attention

77
00:04:09,740 --> 00:04:12,080
to what things cost.

78
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:15,480
Our view is that cost and cost effectiveness

79
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:19,360
are central to understanding
energy challenges.

80
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:21,860
All of the energy
challenges we deal with here

81
00:04:21,860 --> 00:04:24,880
have multiple potential
solutions-- solutions that

82
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:28,780
could work from a standpoint of
pure physics and engineering.

83
00:04:28,780 --> 00:04:30,290
But money matters.

84
00:04:30,290 --> 00:04:35,020
The energy system is 5% or 10% of the
economy, depending on how you count it.

85
00:04:35,020 --> 00:04:39,490
And solutions that work but cost, say,
10 times more than today's technology,

86
00:04:39,490 --> 00:04:42,700
aren't solutions in a world
that has many problems that

87
00:04:42,700 --> 00:04:44,770
need our attention and money.

88
00:04:44,770 --> 00:04:47,280
Finally, history matters.

89
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:51,300
Some familiarity with the history
of previous energy transitions--

90
00:04:51,300 --> 00:04:56,440
of the slow transition from biofuels to
coal, or of the stunningly fast switch

91
00:04:56,440 --> 00:04:59,340
from horses to cars-- is
a necessary background

92
00:04:59,340 --> 00:05:02,390
to any understanding of
the current energy system,

93
00:05:02,390 --> 00:05:06,870
and how it might be transformed to one
that emits nearly zero carbon dioxide,

94
00:05:06,870 --> 00:05:10,520
has a smaller land footprint,
and does less to poison the air.

95
00:05:10,520 --> 00:05:12,770
Could this transformation
be accomplished in 20 years?

96
00:05:12,770 --> 00:05:13,870
A century?

97
00:05:13,870 --> 00:05:16,520
What technologies and
policies could speed it up?

98
00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:19,410
Welcome to Energy Within
Environmental Constraints.

99
00:05:19,410 --> 00:05:20,340
Dive in.

100
00:05:20,340 --> 00:05:21,500
Have fun.

101
00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:24,210
Calculate and debate.
