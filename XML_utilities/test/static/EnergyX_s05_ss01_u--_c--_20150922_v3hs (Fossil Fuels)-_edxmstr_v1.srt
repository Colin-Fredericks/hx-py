0
00:00:00,810 --> 00:00:04,500
Will we run out of fossil
fuels, or, more precisely,

1
00:00:04,500 --> 00:00:08,860
will a gradual scarcity of
fossil fuels drive up their price

2
00:00:08,860 --> 00:00:11,600
so that alternatives outcompete them?

3
00:00:11,600 --> 00:00:16,170
Much of our modern thinking about this
is driven by a very famous 1956 lecture

4
00:00:16,170 --> 00:00:19,250
by a petroleum geologist
called M. King Hubbard.

5
00:00:19,250 --> 00:00:23,380
He used a bell-shaped curve to
predict the US oil production

6
00:00:23,380 --> 00:00:26,870
and correctly predicted the peak in 1970.

7
00:00:26,870 --> 00:00:31,350
In 1973, the Arab oil shock
drove fears of oil scarcity

8
00:00:31,350 --> 00:00:33,020
that persist to this day.

9
00:00:33,020 --> 00:00:36,930
But Hubbard did not predict correctly
the future of US oil production

10
00:00:36,930 --> 00:00:38,270
which has since rebounded.

11
00:00:38,270 --> 00:00:41,670
But since that time fears about peak oil,

12
00:00:41,670 --> 00:00:44,760
fears about an end to the
oil age driven by scarcity

13
00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:49,510
have centered around Hubbard's
prediction of a peak.

14
00:00:49,510 --> 00:00:53,010
My view is that we are threatened
more by the abundance of fossil fuels

15
00:00:53,010 --> 00:00:54,430
than by scarcity.

16
00:00:54,430 --> 00:00:57,250
Of course there will be
local scarcity of some fuels,

17
00:00:57,250 --> 00:01:01,720
and there's a turbulence in the push and
pull between oil supply and oil demand.

18
00:01:01,720 --> 00:01:04,440
But there are at least four
forces that in the long run,

19
00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:07,200
suggest that fossil fuels
will be widely available.

20
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:09,700
The first is technological change.

21
00:01:09,700 --> 00:01:12,770
The second is the geological
diversity of the resource.

22
00:01:12,770 --> 00:01:17,310
The third is price elasticity and
the fourth is inter-fuel substitution

23
00:01:17,310 --> 00:01:18,890
and conversion.

24
00:01:18,890 --> 00:01:22,080
In the next sections, we'll
explore these four factors in order

25
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:26,050
and look at how they explain the
history of oil production in the world.

26
00:01:26,050 --> 00:01:31,210
First, technological change-- the
technologies for finding and extracting

27
00:01:31,210 --> 00:01:34,100
oil and gas just keep getting better.

28
00:01:34,100 --> 00:01:38,100
Two examples-- one is
the shale gas revolution,

29
00:01:38,100 --> 00:01:41,740
where technologies for
drilling long, horizontal wells

30
00:01:41,740 --> 00:01:44,780
and for making fractures
in precise locations

31
00:01:44,780 --> 00:01:48,640
that allow the oil or gas to seep out
of rock that otherwise would be too

32
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:52,350
tight, too impermeable to
allow it to flow naturally

33
00:01:52,350 --> 00:01:54,910
have allowed enormous
expansion of US oil and gas

34
00:01:54,910 --> 00:01:57,280
production using new technologies.

35
00:01:57,280 --> 00:02:00,840
Second, the gradual increase
in the size and efficiency

36
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:05,760
and now automation of mining equipment
allows very large scale coal production

37
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:07,760
at ever-declining costs.

38
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:12,290
Second, geological diversity-- when
one hears about an oil resource,

39
00:02:12,290 --> 00:02:16,940
it's very tempting to imagine
a fixed reservoir, like a tank,

40
00:02:16,940 --> 00:02:19,290
and imagine that as that
tank is gradually depleted,

41
00:02:19,290 --> 00:02:21,380
you get to some point where it's all gone.

42
00:02:21,380 --> 00:02:25,850
That's true for some conventional,
so-called volumetric oil reservoirs.

43
00:02:25,850 --> 00:02:29,230
But hydrocarbons occur in
a vast diversity of forms.

44
00:02:29,230 --> 00:02:32,270
There are immense reservoirs, for
example, of Canadian oil or tar

45
00:02:32,270 --> 00:02:35,150
sands that are well-known deposits.

46
00:02:35,150 --> 00:02:37,090
It's easy to know precisely where they are,

47
00:02:37,090 --> 00:02:40,230
but they're very expensive
to extract and turn into oil.

48
00:02:40,230 --> 00:02:42,410
There are other deposits,
like ultra-deep finds

49
00:02:42,410 --> 00:02:46,900
recently made off the coast of Brazil,
where production is well understood,

50
00:02:46,900 --> 00:02:50,840
but finding them is very difficult.
When you look across the whole world,

51
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:54,980
there is enormous diversity of different
kinds of oil and gas reservoirs.

52
00:02:54,980 --> 00:02:57,210
And that diversity means
that there's no reason

53
00:02:57,210 --> 00:02:59,620
to think about a single fixed supply.

54
00:02:59,620 --> 00:03:03,250
There are larger and larger
supplies of materials

55
00:03:03,250 --> 00:03:05,000
that are harder and harder to get at.

56
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:10,980
Third, price elasticity-- when prices go
up, people work harder to get the oil.

57
00:03:10,980 --> 00:03:15,120
You can see this in this time series
that shows the oil price along

58
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:17,640
with the number of working US oil rigs.

59
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:19,470
See how the to move together.

60
00:03:19,470 --> 00:03:21,330
They're correlated.

61
00:03:21,330 --> 00:03:24,990
Indeed, the technical
definition of oil reserves

62
00:03:24,990 --> 00:03:28,160
is the amount of oil that can be
produced using current technology

63
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:30,210
at the current market price.

64
00:03:30,210 --> 00:03:33,340
This means that if oil
price suddenly goes up,

65
00:03:33,340 --> 00:03:36,880
oil reserves actually go up overnight,
with no change in technology

66
00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:39,420
and no change in the
actual oil in the ground.

67
00:03:39,420 --> 00:03:42,910
Oil reserves are in this sense
partly an economic definition.

68
00:03:42,910 --> 00:03:45,060
The McKelvey box provides
a good way to think

69
00:03:45,060 --> 00:03:49,740
about the role of price, technology, and
geology in determining the availability

70
00:03:49,740 --> 00:03:52,170
of resource, like oil and gas.

71
00:03:52,170 --> 00:03:55,110
This is a system that's used
by economic geologists studying

72
00:03:55,110 --> 00:03:58,490
both oil and gas and other
resources like, say, minerals.

73
00:03:58,490 --> 00:04:01,810
The vertical axis shows the
cost of producing a resource

74
00:04:01,810 --> 00:04:04,530
with current technology,
while the horizontal axis

75
00:04:04,530 --> 00:04:08,260
shows the certainty the resource
exists-- geological certainty.

76
00:04:08,260 --> 00:04:11,950
So you can think about existing
oil and gas reserves or resources

77
00:04:11,950 --> 00:04:13,380
on these two axes.

78
00:04:13,380 --> 00:04:16,010
The Canadian oil or tar sands, for example,

79
00:04:16,010 --> 00:04:19,610
are geologically certain in that
we know precisely where they are.

80
00:04:19,610 --> 00:04:23,500
But the cost of accessing them, the cost
of extracting that oil from the sands

81
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:27,100
and turning it into a marketable
product has been very high,

82
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:30,080
though it's gradually declining
as the technology improves.

83
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:33,700
Finally, the fourth factor driving
the availability of fossil fuels

84
00:04:33,700 --> 00:04:36,730
is inter-fuel substitution and conversion.

85
00:04:36,730 --> 00:04:41,680
Substitution is when a user, for
example, a electricity plant,

86
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:44,880
can choose between using
gas or coal and oil.

87
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:47,390
And so they shift to the cheapest fuel.

88
00:04:47,390 --> 00:04:50,410
This means that when one fuel is
scarce, they can shift to another fuel.

89
00:04:50,410 --> 00:04:54,720
And this provides a kind of economic
interchange between the three fuels,

90
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:58,190
as well as an economic interchange
when users actually switch.

91
00:04:58,190 --> 00:05:01,300
It's physically possible to
turn one fuel into another.

92
00:05:01,300 --> 00:05:04,780
For example, we can turn coal into
a gaseous fuel, so-called coal

93
00:05:04,780 --> 00:05:05,990
gasification.

94
00:05:05,990 --> 00:05:10,290
And we can turn gaseous fuels into
liquid fuels, so-called gas to liquids.

95
00:05:10,290 --> 00:05:13,510
So in the world today we
both turn coal all the way

96
00:05:13,510 --> 00:05:17,260
into liquid fuels, much higher value
fuels that are used for transportation.

97
00:05:17,260 --> 00:05:20,300
And we turn natural gas into liquid fuels.

98
00:05:20,300 --> 00:05:23,640
This conversion allows
another kind of substitution,

99
00:05:23,640 --> 00:05:25,750
separate from the economic substitution.

100
00:05:25,750 --> 00:05:29,800
It means that even if one
fossil fuel runs short,

101
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:32,880
for example that we run out
of oil, running out of oil

102
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:37,580
doesn't mean running out of hydrocarbon
fuels produced from fossil fuels,

103
00:05:37,580 --> 00:05:41,196
because we could produce that
same oil from coal or gas.

104
00:05:41,196 --> 00:05:44,000
To review, we've examined four factors that

105
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:47,040
shape the long-run
availability of fossil fuels.

106
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:51,380
First, technological change;
second, geological diversity;

107
00:05:51,380 --> 00:05:55,870
third, price elasticity; and
fourth, inter-fuel substitution.

108
00:05:55,870 --> 00:06:00,120
Together, these have shaped the
history of the oil age since the 1850s.

109
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:03,840
As an example, look at the
global history of oil production.

110
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:10,630
Note, for example, that between
about 1930 and 1973, the price of oil

111
00:06:10,630 --> 00:06:13,820
was roughly constant in
inflation-adjusted terms,

112
00:06:13,820 --> 00:06:17,240
while the quantity of oil increased 10-fold.

113
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:18,840
How did that happen?

114
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:20,960
It's the story we've been telling, a story

115
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:24,540
of technological change,
increasing ease of access,

116
00:06:24,540 --> 00:06:27,860
competing against scarcity
of the easy resources.

117
00:06:27,860 --> 00:06:31,150
And over that time period, the
competition between those two

118
00:06:31,150 --> 00:06:32,780
came out about even.

119
00:06:32,780 --> 00:06:38,480
But note the sharp discontinuities--
discontinuities in 1973 and since then

120
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:41,980
and some discontinuities
in the late 19th century.

121
00:06:41,980 --> 00:06:47,160
Those were caused by regional pushes and
pull, a turbulence between the dynamics

122
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:49,880
of oil production and oil demand.

123
00:06:49,880 --> 00:06:53,210
There's no doubt that the turbulence
in oil prices will continue.

124
00:06:53,210 --> 00:06:57,040
I don't claim to be able to predict
oil prices a year or five years hence.

125
00:06:57,040 --> 00:07:01,140
A single disaster, natural
disaster or attack on, for example,

126
00:07:01,140 --> 00:07:05,570
the major Saudi loading terminal could
drive oil prices enormously high,

127
00:07:05,570 --> 00:07:08,900
while global economic recession
could drive them much lower.

128
00:07:08,900 --> 00:07:12,360
What these factors do is predict
that the long-run availability

129
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:16,560
of fossil fuels is large, and that
it's unlikely that in the long run,

130
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:20,720
sheer scarcity of fossil fuels
will limit our ability to use them,

131
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:22,910
at least not for centuries.
