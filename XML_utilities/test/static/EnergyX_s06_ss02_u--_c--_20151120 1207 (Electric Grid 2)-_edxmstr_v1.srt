00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:02,910
The job of electricity
planner is to figure out

1
00:00:02,910 --> 00:00:06,560
what generating capacity to build
and how to dispatch that capacity,

2
00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:09,550
how to turn it on and off, in
response to changing loads.

3
00:00:09,550 --> 00:00:12,260
We'll address that second
question first, economic dispatch,

4
00:00:12,260 --> 00:00:14,270
and then turn back to the question of, what

5
00:00:14,270 --> 00:00:16,210
are the most efficient plants to build?

6
00:00:16,210 --> 00:00:18,620
Consider the problem of
efficiently dispatching

7
00:00:18,620 --> 00:00:20,720
a set of pre-existing generators.

8
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:22,650
Imagine you're the operator.

9
00:00:22,650 --> 00:00:25,000
The basic way to minimize
cost is to figure out,

10
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,670
for each generator, what it's
marginal cost of generation is.

11
00:00:28,670 --> 00:00:31,930
That's, what's the cost of each
additional hour for which it

12
00:00:31,930 --> 00:00:32,624
generates power?

13
00:00:32,624 --> 00:00:34,790
Nothing to do with the cost
of turning it on and off

14
00:00:34,790 --> 00:00:39,080
or the cost to build it, just the cost
to generate an extra hour of power.

15
00:00:39,080 --> 00:00:43,230
Then, the fundamental thing that's done
is, you turn on the lowest-cost units

16
00:00:43,230 --> 00:00:44,300
first.

17
00:00:44,300 --> 00:00:48,400
And you keep turning on units until
you have enough power to meet demand.

18
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:51,800
So it's always true that
the unit you turn on last,

19
00:00:51,800 --> 00:00:55,920
the unit that you need to turn on,
is the unit that is generating power

20
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:57,810
at the highest marginal cost.

21
00:00:57,810 --> 00:01:02,290
That highest marginal cost plant
sets the overall marginal power

22
00:01:02,290 --> 00:01:04,379
price on an electric grid.

23
00:01:04,379 --> 00:01:09,030
Here's an example of a dispatch curve
which effectively ranks generators

24
00:01:09,030 --> 00:01:12,550
based on the marginal cost of
generation and the amount of power

25
00:01:12,550 --> 00:01:13,710
they can generate.

26
00:01:13,710 --> 00:01:17,690
So the x-axis shows the total
amount of power generated.

27
00:01:17,690 --> 00:01:19,830
So if you're the operator,
it's the amount of power

28
00:01:19,830 --> 00:01:23,120
that you are requesting from
the system to meet demand.

29
00:01:23,120 --> 00:01:25,850
The y-axis shows the marginal price.

30
00:01:25,850 --> 00:01:29,300
So things that have the lowest
marginal generation costs,

31
00:01:29,300 --> 00:01:32,640
things like renewables or nuclear
power, are far to the left,

32
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:34,450
at the bottom of the x-axis.

33
00:01:34,450 --> 00:01:37,310
And as you go further
along the x-axis, prices

34
00:01:37,310 --> 00:01:39,810
rise, because you're
getting to generators that

35
00:01:39,810 --> 00:01:42,980
have higher and higher marginal cost.

36
00:01:42,980 --> 00:01:47,380
The big knee in the curve, the place
where the price really skyrockets,

37
00:01:47,380 --> 00:01:51,020
is caused by generators that
burn petroleum, burn fuel oil.

38
00:01:51,020 --> 00:01:53,856
Because fuel oil has a
much higher energy cost

39
00:01:53,856 --> 00:01:55,230
than anything else in the system.

40
00:01:55,230 --> 00:01:58,170
Much higher than the cost
of natural gas, for example.

41
00:01:58,170 --> 00:02:01,010
So suppose you're the operator
of this electric power system,

42
00:02:01,010 --> 00:02:03,770
and at some point, demand is 40 gigawatts.

43
00:02:03,770 --> 00:02:05,010
How do you meet it?

44
00:02:05,010 --> 00:02:07,650
You meet it by turning on
the very cheapest things.

45
00:02:07,650 --> 00:02:10,560
First of all, you turn on
renewables, say, solar and wind.

46
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:14,650
Those are supplying power at basically
zero marginal cost if the wind is

47
00:02:14,650 --> 00:02:16,130
blowing or the sun is shining.

48
00:02:16,130 --> 00:02:18,130
Then you turn on the next
cheapest things, which

49
00:02:18,130 --> 00:02:20,550
might be nuclear power
plants or hydro plants,

50
00:02:20,550 --> 00:02:24,410
and you turn on just enough
coal to get to 40 gigawatts.

51
00:02:24,410 --> 00:02:28,420
At that point, the price of the most
expensive generator you've turned on,

52
00:02:28,420 --> 00:02:31,260
which, in this example, would
be a coal-fired power plant,

53
00:02:31,260 --> 00:02:34,960
it would have a marginal cost
of, in this example, about $25

54
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:36,070
a megawatt-hour.

55
00:02:36,070 --> 00:02:39,330
And under the normal way that
electricity markets work,

56
00:02:39,330 --> 00:02:42,060
every generator that you had turned on would

57
00:02:42,060 --> 00:02:44,290
get the same price for electric power.

58
00:02:44,290 --> 00:02:47,210
That price would be determined
by the most expensive generator,

59
00:02:47,210 --> 00:02:50,420
the one you turned on to
meet demand at 40 gigawatts.

60
00:02:50,420 --> 00:02:54,940
And that would be, in this
example, about $25 a megawatt-hour.

61
00:02:54,940 --> 00:02:59,070
Now suppose you have a very hot summer
day, with huge air conditioning loads,

62
00:02:59,070 --> 00:03:02,820
and maybe you've got low wind power output.

63
00:03:02,820 --> 00:03:07,300
So now you need the full 115
or 120 gigawatts of power.

64
00:03:07,300 --> 00:03:10,190
Now, you basically have to turn
on everything in the system,

65
00:03:10,190 --> 00:03:12,231
and that means you're
turning on some things that

66
00:03:12,231 --> 00:03:14,040
have a very high marginal price.

67
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:19,270
One example would be old-fashioned,
inefficient, oil-fired boilers.

68
00:03:19,270 --> 00:03:22,370
Those oil-fired boilers are expensive
because they have low efficiency,

69
00:03:22,370 --> 00:03:26,730
and expensive because oil is in
energy units of very expensive fuel.

70
00:03:26,730 --> 00:03:30,220
Then, those units would be
setting the overall system power

71
00:03:30,220 --> 00:03:34,020
price, which might be as high as
$200 or more per megawatt-hour.

72
00:03:34,020 --> 00:03:36,615
So that means the hydro
or nuclear generators

73
00:03:36,615 --> 00:03:39,160
would be making a huge profit on that day,

74
00:03:39,160 --> 00:03:42,300
but the system needs to
work that way so in the end,

75
00:03:42,300 --> 00:03:45,670
all operators make enough
money to keep themselves going.

76
00:03:45,670 --> 00:03:48,760
For long-distance, high-power
electricity transmission,

77
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:51,940
high-voltage DC is the cutting
edge, although, in fact,

78
00:03:51,940 --> 00:03:55,220
the differences between high-voltage
DC and alternating current

79
00:03:55,220 --> 00:03:56,780
are not that big.

80
00:03:56,780 --> 00:04:01,560
To give you a specific example,
the Hami-Zhengzhou line, an HVDC,

81
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:06,820
high-voltage DC line built in China,
is about 2,200 kilometers in length,

82
00:04:06,820 --> 00:04:09,340
and it transmits eight gigawatts of power,

83
00:04:09,340 --> 00:04:13,200
with 5,000 apps at plus
or minus 800 kilovolts.

84
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:15,260
These lines are amazingly efficient.

85
00:04:15,260 --> 00:04:19,910
Siemens, a major development of HVDC
technologies, has a rule of thumb

86
00:04:19,910 --> 00:04:23,190
that losses are about
3% per 1,000 kilometers.

87
00:04:23,190 --> 00:04:26,930
So this line is likely nearly
95% efficient in transmitting

88
00:04:26,930 --> 00:04:30,710
eight gigawatts of power more
than halfway across China.

89
00:04:30,710 --> 00:04:36,620
It costs about $3.6 billion US to build,
and it was completed in 2014, after

90
00:04:36,620 --> 00:04:38,660
just under two years of construction.

91
00:04:38,660 --> 00:04:41,270
This cost works out to about $1.6 million

92
00:04:41,270 --> 00:04:44,050
per kilometer, which is
similar to cost estimates

93
00:04:44,050 --> 00:04:46,390
for lines in Europe and North America.

94
00:04:46,390 --> 00:04:49,700
Given typical financial
assumptions which you see here,

95
00:04:49,700 --> 00:04:55,170
the cost of power transmission is
less than 1.5 cents per kilowatt hour.
