0
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:02,460
Here are a couple factors.

1
00:00:02,460 --> 00:00:04,620
First of all, there are
very high fixed costs

2
00:00:04,620 --> 00:00:08,760
and low marginal costs-- factors that
can make a monopoly in any industry.

3
00:00:08,760 --> 00:00:11,990
Second of all, there's that need
to balance supply and demand

4
00:00:11,990 --> 00:00:15,600
second by second in a very
tightly coupled system.

5
00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:17,980
Those two factors make it really impossible

6
00:00:17,980 --> 00:00:21,150
to imagine a completely
free market for electricity.

7
00:00:21,150 --> 00:00:24,200
We can solve that second problem
by having central control.

8
00:00:24,200 --> 00:00:28,210
And indeed all electric power systems
have some form of central control

9
00:00:28,210 --> 00:00:31,810
that defines which generator
turns on and off to meet demand

10
00:00:31,810 --> 00:00:35,060
on a second by second, or at
least minute by minute basis.

11
00:00:35,060 --> 00:00:38,420
Beyond that, there's the problem of
market power that comes from the fact

12
00:00:38,420 --> 00:00:42,260
that a relatively small number of
very large electricity generators

13
00:00:42,260 --> 00:00:44,890
feed very inelastic demand.

14
00:00:44,890 --> 00:00:47,770
This combination means that the
owner of one of those generators

15
00:00:47,770 --> 00:00:51,580
could turn off a generator and
actually drive up the system price

16
00:00:51,580 --> 00:00:54,800
so they make more money overall-- more
money from some other generator they

17
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:58,420
oww-- in a way that would allow
a certain kind of market power

18
00:00:58,420 --> 00:01:00,540
that is really unacceptable.

19
00:01:00,540 --> 00:01:04,220
So no electric power systems
work as pure free markets.

20
00:01:04,220 --> 00:01:07,340
All of them have deep
complicated regulation.

21
00:01:07,340 --> 00:01:09,730
Here's an example that
illustrates the problem.

22
00:01:09,730 --> 00:01:12,260
Suppose that I own generation assets.

23
00:01:12,260 --> 00:01:16,190
I own a coal plant, which makes power
that's a very low marginal cost.

24
00:01:16,190 --> 00:01:20,170
And I own a oil plant, which makes
power at very high marginal cost.

25
00:01:20,170 --> 00:01:22,620
Suppose that I wait for a day where demand

26
00:01:22,620 --> 00:01:25,450
is very, very high on the system--
perhaps a hot day with lots

27
00:01:25,450 --> 00:01:26,890
of air conditioning load.

28
00:01:26,890 --> 00:01:28,570
And then I turn off my coal plant.

29
00:01:28,570 --> 00:01:31,200
I can tell people it needs
to go down for maintenance.

30
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:34,300
The system power price will
go up extraordinarily high.

31
00:01:34,300 --> 00:01:38,050
And I'll make so much money on my
oil plant that I'll more the recoup

32
00:01:38,050 --> 00:01:41,530
the fact that I'm not making any money
selling electricity for my coal plant.

33
00:01:41,530 --> 00:01:44,730
That gives an incentive for
gaming that's fundamental.

34
00:01:44,730 --> 00:01:47,840
And we must have regulation
that manages that incentive.

35
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:51,080
And that regulation is inherently complex.

36
00:01:51,080 --> 00:01:53,090
The basic answer to these problems has been

37
00:01:53,090 --> 00:01:57,550
to run electric power systems
as regulated monopoly utilities.

38
00:01:57,550 --> 00:01:59,810
In these systems, there isn't competition.

39
00:01:59,810 --> 00:02:02,280
One entity runs the system.

40
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:07,400
The problem with that is that entity
has then no incentive to reduce prices.

41
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:10,720
So in the classic utility
model, utilities build

42
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:13,030
and they get what's called
a fixed rate of return.

43
00:02:13,030 --> 00:02:14,940
So that means when they build a generator,

44
00:02:14,940 --> 00:02:18,210
they know exactly what
fraction that generator's cost

45
00:02:18,210 --> 00:02:19,736
they're going to get back.

46
00:02:19,736 --> 00:02:21,360
But what incentive does that give them?

47
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:24,370
It gives them the incentive
to increase the costs.

48
00:02:24,370 --> 00:02:27,030
So a problem with that classic utility model

49
00:02:27,030 --> 00:02:29,350
is that under a fixed rate of return system,

50
00:02:29,350 --> 00:02:31,710
generators just jack up their costs.

51
00:02:31,710 --> 00:02:34,181
Our problem with a free
market model is gaming.

52
00:02:34,181 --> 00:02:36,680
The electric power system did
not just spring into operation

53
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:37,970
the last few years.

54
00:02:37,970 --> 00:02:40,910
It's evolved over 125 years.

55
00:02:40,910 --> 00:02:44,230
And it's evolved both in
actual physical infrastructure

56
00:02:44,230 --> 00:02:47,310
in companies that supply
individual pieces of equipment

57
00:02:47,310 --> 00:02:49,910
from generators to long
distance transmission to systems

58
00:02:49,910 --> 00:02:51,390
that use the electricity.

59
00:02:51,390 --> 00:02:54,470
And it's evolved in the legal
and social mechanisms that net

60
00:02:54,470 --> 00:02:56,150
the whole thing together.

61
00:02:56,150 --> 00:02:59,640
So the electric power system
reflects both current technology

62
00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:02,420
and a very long historical evolution.

63
00:03:02,420 --> 00:03:05,950
And that's true most obviously
in places like the United States,

64
00:03:05,950 --> 00:03:10,010
where electric power's been around
since 1882-- the first generator system

65
00:03:10,010 --> 00:03:11,850
that Edison had in New York City.

66
00:03:11,850 --> 00:03:15,100
But it's true even in China, where we're
building out electric power systems

67
00:03:15,100 --> 00:03:15,900
very quickly.

68
00:03:15,900 --> 00:03:20,420
But we're building them out based on
infrastructure and technology that's

69
00:03:20,420 --> 00:03:22,550
been developed over this last century.

70
00:03:22,550 --> 00:03:26,230
So understanding why the system is
the way it is-- why, for example,

71
00:03:26,230 --> 00:03:28,150
is it an alternating current system?

72
00:03:28,150 --> 00:03:31,530
And how we control the system
depends on understanding not just

73
00:03:31,530 --> 00:03:33,970
current technologies, but how the system has

74
00:03:33,970 --> 00:03:38,340
evolved as technologies change
and the institutions that fit

75
00:03:38,340 --> 00:03:40,020
them together changes.

76
00:03:40,020 --> 00:03:43,150
So for example, if you go back to
the beginning of electric power,

77
00:03:43,150 --> 00:03:45,310
the system started first
with Edison's system,

78
00:03:45,310 --> 00:03:48,510
which was a direct current
system that spanned a relatively

79
00:03:48,510 --> 00:03:50,140
small number of city blocks.

80
00:03:50,140 --> 00:03:53,640
It was a low-voltage system that
was a much simpler system to do.

81
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:54,780
And it was safe.

82
00:03:54,780 --> 00:03:57,857
But with low voltage, the
resistive losses are very high.

83
00:03:57,857 --> 00:04:01,190
And there was a competition between that
and the system devised by Westinghouse,

84
00:04:01,190 --> 00:04:03,290
which was an alternating current system--

85
00:04:03,290 --> 00:04:04,750
a system that had transformers.

86
00:04:04,750 --> 00:04:08,750
So it could do high voltage transmission
and lower voltage distribution.

87
00:04:08,750 --> 00:04:10,630
Those systems battle it out for a while.

88
00:04:10,630 --> 00:04:13,730
And that battle was more than
just a simple technical battle.

89
00:04:13,730 --> 00:04:18,300
But it was a complex
industrial and PR battle.

90
00:04:18,300 --> 00:04:22,230
In the end, the Westinghouse system
won because of the enormous advantages

91
00:04:22,230 --> 00:04:26,960
of the ability to do high voltage low
current long distance transmission.

92
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:30,580
But now we have a system where more
and more of electric power demand

93
00:04:30,580 --> 00:04:34,750
is actually inherently DC demand--
for computers, for certain kinds

94
00:04:34,750 --> 00:04:37,750
of high power electronic equipment.

95
00:04:37,750 --> 00:04:41,700
And yet the system is locked
into alternating current.

96
00:04:41,700 --> 00:04:46,090
And so here we see by example
ways in which the system reflects

97
00:04:46,090 --> 00:04:48,730
not just current technological realities,

98
00:04:48,730 --> 00:04:51,880
but the long history of its evolution.
