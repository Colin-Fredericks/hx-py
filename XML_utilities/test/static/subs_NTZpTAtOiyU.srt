00:00:00,840 --> 00:00:03,590
Welcome to the section on quantifying costs.

1
00:00:03,590 --> 00:00:04,810
Energy is expensive.

2
00:00:04,810 --> 00:00:08,900
It's a commodity that costs many
percent of the entire economic output.

3
00:00:08,900 --> 00:00:12,670
So when we make choices-- choices, say,
between coal power and solar power,

4
00:00:12,670 --> 00:00:15,900
between electric vehicles and
conventional vehicles-- those choices

5
00:00:15,900 --> 00:00:17,770
have profound consequences.

6
00:00:17,770 --> 00:00:21,970
And they inevitably involve trade-offs,
trade-offs about how much we spend now,

7
00:00:21,970 --> 00:00:25,480
and trade-offs about how much we
protect the environment and human lives.

8
00:00:25,480 --> 00:00:29,460
The fundamental way that in this
course we will wrap those trade-offs up

9
00:00:29,460 --> 00:00:32,259
is by quantifying the overall cost.

10
00:00:32,259 --> 00:00:35,220
In this course, most of our
work on quantifying cost

11
00:00:35,220 --> 00:00:39,680
will use two techniques-- levelized
cost and cost of mitigation.

12
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:43,210
Levelized cost refers to the
cost for a single alternative,

13
00:00:43,210 --> 00:00:45,530
and the cost that calculates different costs

14
00:00:45,530 --> 00:00:49,770
put together across time-- for example,
the initial cost of a power plant

15
00:00:49,770 --> 00:00:51,990
and then the operating cost of it over time.

16
00:00:51,990 --> 00:00:55,710
There's a way to combine those
to produce a single average cost.

17
00:00:55,710 --> 00:00:58,020
That's called the levelized cost.

18
00:00:58,020 --> 00:01:02,350
The cost of mitigation is always about
a choice between two alternatives.

19
00:01:02,350 --> 00:01:05,060
Suppose you have one power
plant that costs a lot

20
00:01:05,060 --> 00:01:08,750
but doesn't admit very much pollution,
and another power plant which costs

21
00:01:08,750 --> 00:01:10,940
less but does emit more pollution.

22
00:01:10,940 --> 00:01:14,070
You can compare the two
alternatives and calculate

23
00:01:14,070 --> 00:01:17,810
the cost of saving pollution, which
might be in cost per ton of pollution

24
00:01:17,810 --> 00:01:19,000
you saved.

25
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,820
Those are the two fundamental
techniques we'll use,

26
00:01:21,820 --> 00:01:25,270
and we want you to learn how
to use those across the course

27
00:01:25,270 --> 00:01:29,170
and be familiar with calculating them
for everything from large power plants

28
00:01:29,170 --> 00:01:32,360
to individual choices you
might make around your house.

29
00:01:32,360 --> 00:01:36,550
The two topics are the levelized
cost for a single alternative,

30
00:01:36,550 --> 00:01:38,690
and the cost of mitigation,
which always comes

31
00:01:38,690 --> 00:01:41,120
when you compare two alternatives.

32
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:42,940
We will teach you formulas that allow you

33
00:01:42,940 --> 00:01:46,970
to calculate the levelized cost and cost
of mitigation with very high precision.

34
00:01:46,970 --> 00:01:48,960
You can calculate it to 1%.

35
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:53,190
But we also want you to understand all
the limitations of these calculations.

36
00:01:53,190 --> 00:01:56,810
These calculations include all
sorts of hidden uncertainties,

37
00:01:56,810 --> 00:01:59,940
and we want you to at least know
what those uncertainties are.

38
00:01:59,940 --> 00:02:02,250
One of the single most
important uncertainties

39
00:02:02,250 --> 00:02:05,810
is the uncertainty hidden in the
interest or discount rate that's

40
00:02:05,810 --> 00:02:07,690
used in the levelized cost formula.

41
00:02:07,690 --> 00:02:10,870
We'll come back to that in detail
at the end of this section.

42
00:02:10,870 --> 00:02:13,750
How much would you pay me for
the legally binding promise

43
00:02:13,750 --> 00:02:16,510
that I would give you $1 a year from now?

44
00:02:16,510 --> 00:02:18,040
Think about it.

45
00:02:18,040 --> 00:02:20,410
Your answer should be less than $1.

46
00:02:20,410 --> 00:02:25,000
$1 a year from now is worth less than
$1 today, and the amount that it's worth

47
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,690
less is called the discount rate.

48
00:02:26,690 --> 00:02:31,280
If the discount rate is 10%, then you
should pay me $0.90 for my promise

49
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:33,230
of $1 a year from now.

50
00:02:33,230 --> 00:02:36,630
The discount rate is the amount
that future costs or benefits are

51
00:02:36,630 --> 00:02:39,550
discounted compared to current costs.

52
00:02:39,550 --> 00:02:41,830
So why do we discount the future at all?

53
00:02:41,830 --> 00:02:43,690
Here are three reasons.

54
00:02:43,690 --> 00:02:45,970
The first is what's called pure hedonic time

55
00:02:45,970 --> 00:02:49,090
preference, where hedonic
comes from hedonism, the fact

56
00:02:49,090 --> 00:02:50,630
that you like pleasure.

57
00:02:50,630 --> 00:02:53,420
So if I offer you the choice
of an ice cream cone today

58
00:02:53,420 --> 00:02:57,480
or an ice cream cone a year from now,
you prefer the ice cream cone today

59
00:02:57,480 --> 00:03:01,900
simply because, all else equal, you'd
rather have your pleasures today.

60
00:03:01,900 --> 00:03:03,750
Second is uncertainty.

61
00:03:03,750 --> 00:03:06,260
If I offer you that ice
cream cone a year from now,

62
00:03:06,260 --> 00:03:09,550
you don't know for sure that
I'll be able to honor my offer.

63
00:03:09,550 --> 00:03:12,220
Maybe I'll be dead, maybe you'll be dead,

64
00:03:12,220 --> 00:03:13,960
maybe you won't like ice cream anymore.

65
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:16,080
There are all sorts of uncertainties.

66
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:18,540
That's a separate concept
from hedonic time preference.

67
00:03:18,540 --> 00:03:21,040
It has to do with the fact that
you don't know for sure what

68
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:23,810
will happen in the future, but
you know much more certainly

69
00:03:23,810 --> 00:03:25,330
what will happen now.

70
00:03:25,330 --> 00:03:28,240
And that uncertainty about the
future is a fundamental reason

71
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:31,080
that we discount future costs and benefits.

72
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:33,840
We don't know for sure that
we're going to get them.

73
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:36,690
Then there's a third related
concept that doesn't directly

74
00:03:36,690 --> 00:03:38,870
applied to our ice cream example, but does

75
00:03:38,870 --> 00:03:42,600
apply whenever you're thinking about
something that costs a lot of money.

76
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:45,730
There's always something else you
could have done with that money,

77
00:03:45,730 --> 00:03:47,850
and the fact that you don't do it represents

78
00:03:47,850 --> 00:03:49,900
what's called an opportunity cost.

79
00:03:49,900 --> 00:03:53,140
You've lost the opportunity to do
something else with that money,

80
00:03:53,140 --> 00:03:57,170
like invest it in something that would
have produced more money over time.

81
00:03:57,170 --> 00:04:00,720
And that tie to alternative
things you could have done with it

82
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:04,210
is yet another recent we
discount future costs.

83
00:04:04,210 --> 00:04:08,110
Let's dig a little deeper into
opportunity cost and discounting.

84
00:04:08,110 --> 00:04:09,870
Many people in the environmental community

85
00:04:09,870 --> 00:04:13,210
would like to believe the discount
rate should be very low, almost 0,

86
00:04:13,210 --> 00:04:17,089
because they want to justify investments
in energy- and pollution-saving

87
00:04:17,089 --> 00:04:18,339
technologies.

88
00:04:18,339 --> 00:04:20,750
I want to see investment
in those technologies, too,

89
00:04:20,750 --> 00:04:23,799
but we need to take discounting
seriously and here's why.

90
00:04:23,799 --> 00:04:26,340
Suppose that you think discount
rate should be extremely low.

91
00:04:26,340 --> 00:04:29,480
For the sake of argument, say
you think they should be 0.

92
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:34,230
That means you should be willing to lend
me $1 now and be happy to get just $1

93
00:04:34,230 --> 00:04:35,860
back in 5 years.

94
00:04:35,860 --> 00:04:39,580
But this would be a great deal for
me because I can invest that dollar

95
00:04:39,580 --> 00:04:42,730
in some super low-risk
government bond, for example,

96
00:04:42,730 --> 00:04:46,670
and be certain to have more
money, say $1.20, in 5 years.

97
00:04:46,670 --> 00:04:50,870
That means if you give me that loan,
I'm effectively just printing money.

98
00:04:50,870 --> 00:04:53,910
This shows the opportunity
cost in stark terms.

99
00:04:53,910 --> 00:04:57,090
Money in the future really
is worth less because there

100
00:04:57,090 --> 00:05:00,370
are other things you could have done
with the money that give you certainty

101
00:05:00,370 --> 00:05:02,550
of growing your money over time.

102
00:05:02,550 --> 00:05:04,830
That is a fundamental
reason why we can't just

103
00:05:04,830 --> 00:05:09,400
ignore the fact that there really
is monetary discounting over time.

104
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:13,400
So what's the right discount rate to
use in energy system calculations?

105
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:16,160
The answer is there is no right answer.

106
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:19,870
The different discount rates really
make sense for different individuals,

107
00:05:19,870 --> 00:05:22,750
corporations, or governments
making the decisions.

108
00:05:22,750 --> 00:05:24,370
Here are some examples.

109
00:05:24,370 --> 00:05:27,890
Individuals in their own lives tend
to use pretty high discount rates

110
00:05:27,890 --> 00:05:31,790
because there's lots of uncertainty and
people don't have the kind of certainty

111
00:05:31,790 --> 00:05:33,676
of savings that a government does.

112
00:05:33,676 --> 00:05:35,800
Think about a poor person,
maybe a starving person.

113
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:38,230
Their discount rate is
extremely high because they

114
00:05:38,230 --> 00:05:40,610
have very few alternatives.

115
00:05:40,610 --> 00:05:43,990
But a large, stable government
can have a very low discount rate

116
00:05:43,990 --> 00:05:46,250
because they can safely wait for payback.

117
00:05:46,250 --> 00:05:49,390
The main factor is simply the
opportunity cost of the investment.

118
00:05:49,390 --> 00:05:53,460
Governments often use discount
rates around 5% or even lower.

119
00:05:53,460 --> 00:05:56,420
A large company, like, say, Shell or Exxon,

120
00:05:56,420 --> 00:06:00,260
can also use quite low discount
rates, close to a government rate,

121
00:06:00,260 --> 00:06:02,970
because they make long-term
investments confident

122
00:06:02,970 --> 00:06:06,490
their company will exist
10 or 20 years from now.

123
00:06:06,490 --> 00:06:09,670
Think about a small, solar-powered
startup company or a company

124
00:06:09,670 --> 00:06:10,940
doing fracking.

125
00:06:10,940 --> 00:06:13,040
Those companies tend to
use shorter discount rates

126
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:14,790
because in a small startup, you don't know

127
00:06:14,790 --> 00:06:17,110
for sure your company
will exist in 10 years,

128
00:06:17,110 --> 00:06:19,590
and so you have to think shorter-term.

129
00:06:19,590 --> 00:06:21,080
There's no right rate.

130
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:24,150
The rate depends on the
agent making the decision.

131
00:06:24,150 --> 00:06:27,190
What you need to do is think
carefully about the way

132
00:06:27,190 --> 00:06:31,990
the rate you choose in an energy system
calculation is suitable or not suitable

133
00:06:31,990 --> 00:06:35,880
for the decision you're
trying to make or advise.

134
00:06:35,880 --> 00:06:40,030
And think about the fact that that rate
can determine the answer to the energy

135
00:06:40,030 --> 00:06:41,390
system analysis.

136
00:06:41,390 --> 00:06:44,530
As a specific example, suppose
you want to supply energy

137
00:06:44,530 --> 00:06:46,830
for some off-grid
application, and your choice

138
00:06:46,830 --> 00:06:50,800
is solar with a battery backup
or a gasoline-powered generator.

139
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:53,570
Think about the difference between
these two systems and the way

140
00:06:53,570 --> 00:06:55,400
that discount rate matters.

141
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:58,050
The solar system has a
much higher capital cost,

142
00:06:58,050 --> 00:07:00,020
a much higher first purchase cost.

143
00:07:00,020 --> 00:07:02,260
Gasoline generators are really cheap to buy,

144
00:07:02,260 --> 00:07:05,800
but they have high operating cost
that depends on the cost of gasoline.

145
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:07,030
So which should you buy?

146
00:07:07,030 --> 00:07:09,670
As you've learned in the
earlier part of this section,

147
00:07:09,670 --> 00:07:12,550
you can calculate the levelized
cost of electricity for both

148
00:07:12,550 --> 00:07:14,260
and choose whatever is lowest.

149
00:07:14,260 --> 00:07:17,510
But the heart of that LCOE
calculation is the formula

150
00:07:17,510 --> 00:07:20,030
that takes cost in future
years and converts them

151
00:07:20,030 --> 00:07:22,720
to an equivalent current year cost.

152
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:26,500
In our formula, the discount rate
is a fixed percentage per year,

153
00:07:26,500 --> 00:07:29,560
and it compounds, so the
value of a future dollar

154
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:33,620
decays exponentially in the
future as you see in this plot.

155
00:07:33,620 --> 00:07:38,610
So that means if the rate is 10%, $1
a year from now is only worth $0.90

156
00:07:38,610 --> 00:07:39,590
today.

157
00:07:39,590 --> 00:07:44,450
And 10 years out, that dollar
is only worth $0.35 today.

158
00:07:44,450 --> 00:07:47,080
The choice of discount rate
can determine the answer

159
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:49,410
to the solar versus generator question.

160
00:07:49,410 --> 00:07:52,690
If you choose a high discount
rate, then the future costs

161
00:07:52,690 --> 00:07:56,370
of gasoline, those operational
costs, don't look very important

162
00:07:56,370 --> 00:07:59,470
because those costs are
in discounted dollars.

163
00:07:59,470 --> 00:08:03,470
But if you choose a very low discount
rate, then the costs of gasoline

164
00:08:03,470 --> 00:08:06,990
keep mounting up and you're
going to choose the solar system.

165
00:08:06,990 --> 00:08:09,750
So the choice between
high and low discount rate

166
00:08:09,750 --> 00:08:12,660
determined the choice of solar versus gas.

167
00:08:12,660 --> 00:08:16,255
When discount rates are high, then
first capital costs look most important

168
00:08:16,255 --> 00:08:18,930
and you'll choose the gas-powered generator.

169
00:08:18,930 --> 00:08:22,540
But when discount rates are low, that
operating cost looked more important,

170
00:08:22,540 --> 00:08:24,710
and you'll choose the solar-powered system.

171
00:08:24,710 --> 00:08:27,900
The choice of discount rate turns
out to make an enormous difference

172
00:08:27,900 --> 00:08:31,580
to climate policy, one of the
central topics of this course.

173
00:08:31,580 --> 00:08:34,570
If you spend money to cut
carbon dioxide emissions now,

174
00:08:34,570 --> 00:08:39,190
say by replacing a coal-fired plant
with solar power or nuclear power,

175
00:08:39,190 --> 00:08:41,570
the benefits in terms
of reduced climate risks

176
00:08:41,570 --> 00:08:43,970
come, as we will learn, in a distant future.

177
00:08:43,970 --> 00:08:46,600
Many of the benefits are felt 100 years out.

178
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:49,000
So how do we value those benefits?

179
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,480
That depends in turn on discount rate.

180
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:54,450
And if you choose a typical
market discount rate,

181
00:08:54,450 --> 00:08:56,300
then the distant future 100 years from now

182
00:08:56,300 --> 00:08:58,670
looks almost completely unimportant.

183
00:08:58,670 --> 00:09:00,980
Suppose, for example, you
choose a discount rate

184
00:09:00,980 --> 00:09:06,110
of 5%, which is a common choice
for ordinary policy analysis.

185
00:09:06,110 --> 00:09:10,290
At a discount rate of 5%, the
costs are discounted in 100 years

186
00:09:10,290 --> 00:09:14,390
by a factor of 130 to 0.8%.

187
00:09:14,390 --> 00:09:15,750
Does that make any sense?

188
00:09:15,750 --> 00:09:17,770
It's a highly controversial question, one

189
00:09:17,770 --> 00:09:21,260
that lies at the very heart of
disputes about climate policy.

190
00:09:21,260 --> 00:09:23,530
Think about it in terms of human lives.

191
00:09:23,530 --> 00:09:27,930
What would you choose between
saving one life today and 130 lives

192
00:09:27,930 --> 00:09:29,490
100 years from now?

193
00:09:29,490 --> 00:09:32,260
That's what it means to
use a discount rate of 5%.

194
00:09:32,260 --> 00:09:33,590
What's the right number?

195
00:09:33,590 --> 00:09:34,860
There's no easy answer.

196
00:09:34,860 --> 00:09:37,420
You might be tempted to say,
of course, a life is a life.

197
00:09:37,420 --> 00:09:39,530
130 lives are much more important.

198
00:09:39,530 --> 00:09:42,280
But you can't be sure that
any action you do today

199
00:09:42,280 --> 00:09:45,170
will actually save lives 130 years from now.

200
00:09:45,170 --> 00:09:49,310
So even for lives we should apply
some discounting, I believe.

201
00:09:49,310 --> 00:09:50,500
But how to do it?

202
00:09:50,500 --> 00:09:51,710
Deeply unclear.

203
00:09:51,710 --> 00:09:53,760
And in that single number of discount rate,

204
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:57,990
we hide many of the core disputes
that really matter in making decisions

205
00:09:57,990 --> 00:09:59,950
about energy and environmental policy.

206
00:09:59,950 --> 00:10:02,630
Because time and time again, our choice is

207
00:10:02,630 --> 00:10:07,150
whether we want to spend money today
to reduce air pollution or climate

208
00:10:07,150 --> 00:10:10,030
pollution which will
cause harm in the future.

209
00:10:10,030 --> 00:10:12,810
And the distinction, the
cost benefit analysis,

210
00:10:12,810 --> 00:10:17,020
that allows us to choose what to
do depends on the discount rate.

211
00:10:17,020 --> 00:10:19,190
There's no right answer,
but you need to think

212
00:10:19,190 --> 00:10:23,710
hard about what rate is right for the
kind of decisions you want to make

213
00:10:23,710 --> 00:10:26,860
or the kind of advice you
want to give to policymakers.

214
00:10:26,860 --> 00:10:30,960
In conclusion, don't take the
issue of discounting lightly.

215
00:10:30,960 --> 00:10:34,020
Be skeptical of expert claims
that they know exactly what's

216
00:10:34,020 --> 00:10:35,990
the right answer for discounting.

217
00:10:35,990 --> 00:10:39,040
Perhaps the following anecdote
will help you think about the way

218
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:42,020
that underlying values
determine these choices

219
00:10:42,020 --> 00:10:46,600
in ways that are not easy to incorporate
in a single number, a discount rate.

220
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:49,560
I've worked on energy and
environmental policy personally

221
00:10:49,560 --> 00:10:52,730
for about half my life-- about 25 years.

222
00:10:52,730 --> 00:10:55,930
And if I take the simplest
economic formulation

223
00:10:55,930 --> 00:10:58,810
of what we call optimal climate
policy, which at its core

224
00:10:58,810 --> 00:11:03,520
is a cost benefit analysis, and
according to the standard economic cost

225
00:11:03,520 --> 00:11:07,130
benefit analysis, which has
discounting near its heart,

226
00:11:07,130 --> 00:11:11,220
the reason that I and other people
are working to reduce CO2 emissions

227
00:11:11,220 --> 00:11:15,760
now is because it will make people
a few percent richer in 100 years.

228
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:18,310
That's because the benefits
of cutting carbon emissions

229
00:11:18,310 --> 00:11:21,630
are larger than the cost once
you've applied discounting.

230
00:11:21,630 --> 00:11:23,070
But do I really do that?

231
00:11:23,070 --> 00:11:25,000
Do I really think about it that way?

232
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,370
I can tell you honestly that I don't.

233
00:11:27,370 --> 00:11:29,820
I would still think we should
reduce carbon emissions

234
00:11:29,820 --> 00:11:32,430
and reduce the way we're
changing the environment, even

235
00:11:32,430 --> 00:11:35,750
if it made everybody poorer 100 years
from now-- at least a little bit

236
00:11:35,750 --> 00:11:36,600
poorer.

237
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:40,040
However, I think that discounting
is very useful and highly

238
00:11:40,040 --> 00:11:42,595
relevant for making choices in one country

239
00:11:42,595 --> 00:11:46,170
or one society in a
relatively short time period,

240
00:11:46,170 --> 00:11:49,750
and we need to think analytically
about what the trade-offs are.

241
00:11:49,750 --> 00:11:50,940
There's no right answer.

242
00:11:50,940 --> 00:11:54,100
I encourage you to think about
what kind of discount rate

243
00:11:54,100 --> 00:11:57,410
you think is right for the
actual problems at hand,

244
00:11:57,410 --> 00:11:59,680
and be skeptical about
expert claims that people

245
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:03,080
know exactly what's the right rate.
