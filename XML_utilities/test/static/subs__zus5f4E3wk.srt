Welcome to Energy within
Environmental Constraints.

1
00:00:04,150 --> 00:00:06,750
This course focuses on the energy system,

2
00:00:06,750 --> 00:00:11,400
on the nuts and bolts of how it works,
how energy flows from gas wells or wind

3
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:16,450
turbines through modern economies to
power indoor lighting or heavy trucks.

4
00:00:16,450 --> 00:00:18,450
Not just the flow of materials, but the flow

5
00:00:18,450 --> 00:00:22,870
of money, which determines the
cost of electricity or diesel fuel.

6
00:00:22,870 --> 00:00:26,440
Our goal is not a static
description of the energy system

7
00:00:26,440 --> 00:00:31,340
but rather a description that helps you
understand how it might be improved.

8
00:00:31,340 --> 00:00:34,350
Whether you are working in an
energy company, a government

9
00:00:34,350 --> 00:00:37,000
agency, or an environmental
group, whether you

10
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,330
are a student who hopes to work in energy

11
00:00:39,330 --> 00:00:42,230
or a citizen who cares about
energy in the environment,

12
00:00:42,230 --> 00:00:45,700
you want to figure out how to
make the system work better.

13
00:00:45,700 --> 00:00:49,720
"Better" could mean lots of things--
cheaper, less environmentally

14
00:00:49,720 --> 00:00:54,320
destructive, more profitable,
more secure, or more democratic.

15
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:58,350
Our focus is on improving the
environmental performance of the energy

16
00:00:58,350 --> 00:00:59,550
system.

17
00:00:59,550 --> 00:01:03,450
That is only possible if you have some
rough understanding of how the energy

18
00:01:03,450 --> 00:01:08,020
system works and its most important
environmental constraints, particularly

19
00:01:08,020 --> 00:01:10,170
air pollution and climate change.

20
00:01:10,170 --> 00:01:13,820
But this is not a broad survey
of energy and the environment.

21
00:01:13,820 --> 00:01:17,240
Our focus is on the energy system
within environment constraints,

22
00:01:17,240 --> 00:01:20,860
which we will teach in less
depth as boundary conditions.

23
00:01:20,860 --> 00:01:23,370
This course aspires to a global perspective

24
00:01:23,370 --> 00:01:26,970
although many of our examples are
drawn from the US energy system,

25
00:01:26,970 --> 00:01:31,450
and it aims to look out over the
next half century or more asking

26
00:01:31,450 --> 00:01:35,390
how the energy system might evolve
to provide energy with a far

27
00:01:35,390 --> 00:01:37,310
smaller environmental impact.

28
00:01:37,310 --> 00:01:40,050
Environment is not the only energy problem.

29
00:01:40,050 --> 00:01:44,610
Before diving in, I want to give
you my view of how environment fits

30
00:01:44,610 --> 00:01:47,410
into the spectrum of energy challenges.

31
00:01:47,410 --> 00:01:51,200
It's useful to think of three
grand energy challenges.

32
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:53,640
First, energy access.

33
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:58,430
About 1.3 billion people lack
access to electricity, and roughly 2

34
00:01:58,430 --> 00:02:02,120
and 1/2 billion lack access
to modern cooking technology.

35
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:04,600
I don't mean fancy induction stoves.

36
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:07,520
I mean anything other than indoor fires.

37
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:10,340
Lack of access to these
basic energy services

38
00:02:10,340 --> 00:02:13,120
is a profound impediment
that people struggle

39
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:14,960
to improve their own well-being.

40
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:18,880
Without lighting, for example, one
cannot study at night after outdoor

41
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:19,910
work is done.

42
00:02:19,910 --> 00:02:22,430
Second, energy security.

43
00:02:22,430 --> 00:02:25,310
The links between energy
and conflict are ancient.

44
00:02:25,310 --> 00:02:28,820
The Romans could not have assembled
their armies without an energy system

45
00:02:28,820 --> 00:02:31,830
that moved food and forged metals.

46
00:02:31,830 --> 00:02:34,710
The British decision to
switch to an oil-fired navy

47
00:02:34,710 --> 00:02:38,030
before the First World War
greatly increased the navy's speed

48
00:02:38,030 --> 00:02:41,150
and lethality, but it came
with a political decision

49
00:02:41,150 --> 00:02:46,330
to found the Anglo-Persian Oil Company
based on access to oil fields in Iran--

50
00:02:46,330 --> 00:02:48,690
then partially under British control.

51
00:02:48,690 --> 00:02:52,060
That company is now called
"BP," and oil related conflict

52
00:02:52,060 --> 00:02:54,510
is still central to geopolitics.

53
00:02:54,510 --> 00:02:57,520
Likewise, the links between
nuclear energy and conflict

54
00:02:57,520 --> 00:02:59,830
could hardly be tighter.

55
00:02:59,830 --> 00:03:04,650
Third and finally, energy in the
environment-- the topic of this course.

56
00:03:04,650 --> 00:03:07,880
Air pollution from energy use
kills millions of people each year

57
00:03:07,880 --> 00:03:11,520
worldwide and shortens the lives
of people in polluted cities

58
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:13,360
by many years.

59
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:15,950
Carbon dioxide from fossil fuel combustion

60
00:03:15,950 --> 00:03:20,090
is on track to change the world's
climate at a pace and direction

61
00:03:20,090 --> 00:03:24,670
that the planet has not witnessed
for perhaps 55 million years.

62
00:03:24,670 --> 00:03:28,140
The rest of the course will focus on
problems at the intersection of energy

63
00:03:28,140 --> 00:03:29,720
and the environment.

64
00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:32,912
Climate is a topic that draws
many to study energy technology.

65
00:03:32,912 --> 00:03:37,600
I have worked on climate and
energy for half my life, 25 years.

66
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:42,880
Climate is a huge challenge, but I urge
you not to become a climate monomaniac.

67
00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:47,850
Other energy problems have real human
costs, and reforming the energy system

68
00:03:47,850 --> 00:03:50,770
involves hard choices that
sometimes bring these competing

69
00:03:50,770 --> 00:03:52,610
goals into conflict.

70
00:03:52,610 --> 00:03:56,390
We hope that you will adopt
three broad learning goals as you

71
00:03:56,390 --> 00:03:58,390
work your way through this course.

72
00:03:58,390 --> 00:04:02,300
First, to learn a web of
interrelated facts and skills

73
00:04:02,300 --> 00:04:06,867
sufficient to enable sound judgment
about energy technology and policy.

74
00:04:06,867 --> 00:04:08,700
Of course, you can never know all the facts.

75
00:04:08,700 --> 00:04:11,720
And on this topic, many "facts" aren't.

76
00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:15,480
Lots of facts in the energy world
are contested and uncertain.

77
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:19,490
But if you know some basic background
information, some reliable sources

78
00:04:19,490 --> 00:04:23,220
of data, and you learn how to make
quantitative estimates about energy

79
00:04:23,220 --> 00:04:26,070
resources, costs, and environmental impacts,

80
00:04:26,070 --> 00:04:29,470
you have the tools to critically
analyze energy challenges

81
00:04:29,470 --> 00:04:32,350
and, thus, to contribute to overcoming them.

82
00:04:32,350 --> 00:04:35,420
Second, to develop a unified
understanding of energy

83
00:04:35,420 --> 00:04:38,730
flows and transformations
in industrial society--

84
00:04:38,730 --> 00:04:41,750
the flows of energy, from
sources like solar or coal,

85
00:04:41,750 --> 00:04:45,440
to end uses, like lighting or air
travel, and the transformations

86
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:49,020
from coal to diesel fuel or
from electricity to aluminum.

87
00:04:49,020 --> 00:04:53,750
And third, to gain a rough quantitative
overview of some of the most important

88
00:04:53,750 --> 00:04:56,760
links between energy and
environmental systems.

89
00:04:56,760 --> 00:05:00,270
Why exactly do dieselectrics
cause so much air pollution?

90
00:05:00,270 --> 00:05:03,920
How can you estimate the impact of
that air pollution on human health?

91
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:06,580
How do carbon emissions
today cause climate change

92
00:05:06,580 --> 00:05:09,320
today or in the 23rd century?

93
00:05:09,320 --> 00:05:11,370
How do you compare the cost effectiveness

94
00:05:11,370 --> 00:05:14,020
of different ways of
reducing our climate impact,

95
00:05:14,020 --> 00:05:19,360
say, installing efficient lighting
versus reducing natural gas leaks.
