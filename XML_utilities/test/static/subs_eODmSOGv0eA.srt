00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:03,450
One of the hot topics in
electricity is smart grid,

1
00:00:03,450 --> 00:00:06,180
and this idea sometimes takes
on almost magical properties

2
00:00:06,180 --> 00:00:09,990
and can mean almost anything
in the eyes of its exponents.

3
00:00:09,990 --> 00:00:12,119
There are some ideas
underneath that really matter,

4
00:00:12,119 --> 00:00:15,160
but it's important, first of all, to
say that the existing system we have

5
00:00:15,160 --> 00:00:17,230
is, in many ways, very smart.

6
00:00:17,230 --> 00:00:20,410
It smartly dispatches
a whole complicated set

7
00:00:20,410 --> 00:00:23,240
of interconnected generators to meet demand

8
00:00:23,240 --> 00:00:26,020
and it does it with
extraordinarily high reliability.

9
00:00:26,020 --> 00:00:27,370
So the system already is smart.

10
00:00:27,370 --> 00:00:30,550
The question is how we can
add modern digital tools

11
00:00:30,550 --> 00:00:32,600
to make it a little bit smarter.

12
00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:35,190
And there are several ways
this might happen, all of which

13
00:00:35,190 --> 00:00:38,160
are often called smart grid but
there's no single idea here,

14
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:39,970
really a collection of ideas.

15
00:00:39,970 --> 00:00:42,050
One example is smart
meters, which would allow

16
00:00:42,050 --> 00:00:46,110
demand in homes or small businesses
to respond to the real time minute

17
00:00:46,110 --> 00:00:47,760
by minute system price.

18
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:50,620
This would allow demand
centers in those homes--

19
00:00:50,620 --> 00:00:53,820
say, appliances like
refrigerators or central heating--

20
00:00:53,820 --> 00:00:56,050
to respond to the dynamic price.

21
00:00:56,050 --> 00:01:00,010
So for example, your refrigerator
might turn off at just the time

22
00:01:00,010 --> 00:01:03,690
that prices were very high, allowing
the rest the system to respond

23
00:01:03,690 --> 00:01:05,890
more smoothly to some transient.

24
00:01:05,890 --> 00:01:09,670
Another example would be real
time monitoring of power quality

25
00:01:09,670 --> 00:01:11,720
abnormalities, network failures.

26
00:01:11,720 --> 00:01:15,510
And this would allow less need for
technicians to go look for problems.

27
00:01:15,510 --> 00:01:19,480
Another example are new high power
solid state electronic switches

28
00:01:19,480 --> 00:01:22,870
that would allow more fine
grained control of transmission

29
00:01:22,870 --> 00:01:24,640
and distribution infrastructure.

30
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:26,970
That would allow us to avoid failures better

31
00:01:26,970 --> 00:01:30,370
and to more efficiently
utilize existing hardware.

32
00:01:30,370 --> 00:01:34,810
The combination of better real time
monitoring and more responsive demand

33
00:01:34,810 --> 00:01:38,020
might allow us to use the existing
generating capacity a little bit more

34
00:01:38,020 --> 00:01:42,030
efficiently, perhaps reducing the amount
of so-called spinning reserve, that

35
00:01:42,030 --> 00:01:44,780
is power plants that are
available to meet changes in load

36
00:01:44,780 --> 00:01:47,480
at a moment's notice, limit
that, and still achieve

37
00:01:47,480 --> 00:01:49,410
the same amount of reliability.

38
00:01:49,410 --> 00:01:53,140
Finally, we could imagine more improved
management of numerous distributed

39
00:01:53,140 --> 00:01:54,250
generators.

40
00:01:54,250 --> 00:01:57,460
These changes and more comprise
what's called smart grid.

41
00:01:57,460 --> 00:02:00,790
And there's no doubt that the
grid can get smarter and better,

42
00:02:00,790 --> 00:02:03,290
but it's important to understand
that there's no magic here.

43
00:02:03,290 --> 00:02:06,012
The existing grid already
is quite smart and all

44
00:02:06,012 --> 00:02:09,220
we will do by making it smarter is make
it a little more efficient in the way

45
00:02:09,220 --> 00:02:13,410
power is moved around and the way
demand and supply are matched.

46
00:02:13,410 --> 00:02:15,930
So what price should you,
or perhaps a small business,

47
00:02:15,930 --> 00:02:20,810
get if you generate electricity
locally, say solar on a rooftop,

48
00:02:20,810 --> 00:02:22,930
and feed some power back into the grid?

49
00:02:22,930 --> 00:02:27,230
Net metering is the idea that you would
get paid the same amount per kilowatt

50
00:02:27,230 --> 00:02:29,440
hour that you generate in feed to the grid

51
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:32,750
as you pay for a kilowatt
hour you use from the grid.

52
00:02:32,750 --> 00:02:35,290
This seems like a fair
deal, but in fact it's not.

53
00:02:35,290 --> 00:02:38,960
It actually hides a big chunk
of the value of the grid itself.

54
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:42,340
So the actual average power
pool price on the grid,

55
00:02:42,340 --> 00:02:46,390
the price that big generators get,
is significantly lower than the price

56
00:02:46,390 --> 00:02:47,320
you pay.

57
00:02:47,320 --> 00:02:49,560
That difference isn't
some kind of weird profit.

58
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:52,470
That difference corresponds to the
cost of the entire transmission

59
00:02:52,470 --> 00:02:55,990
and generation infrastructure and
all the backups necessary to make

60
00:02:55,990 --> 00:02:58,480
it work at very high reliability.

61
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:01,940
A way to see that this is a subsidy
is to imagine the following.

62
00:03:01,940 --> 00:03:05,920
Suppose that over a year, the
average amount of power you use

63
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:08,330
is zero-- that is, suppose
that at some points

64
00:03:08,330 --> 00:03:11,490
you're using maybe up to 10 kilowatts
of power and at other points

65
00:03:11,490 --> 00:03:13,470
you're feeding 10 kilowatts of power back

66
00:03:13,470 --> 00:03:15,540
to the grid whenever you feel like it.

67
00:03:15,540 --> 00:03:18,600
Under net metering, you'd
pay zero because you'd

68
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:21,900
be using the same number of
kilowatt hours as you supplied.

69
00:03:21,900 --> 00:03:25,000
But obviously, that doesn't
correspond to the actual value

70
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:28,440
because you got, by accessing
the grid, the ability

71
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:32,910
to get 10 kilowatts of power in a
millisecond whenever you want it

72
00:03:32,910 --> 00:03:35,160
and that costs a lot to supply.

73
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:38,840
For you to get the same level
of reliability yourself,

74
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:43,370
you'd have to have a very elaborate
and expensive battery backup system.

75
00:03:43,370 --> 00:03:46,620
The distinction is clear when you
look at how big industrial users are

76
00:03:46,620 --> 00:03:48,060
charged for electricity.

77
00:03:48,060 --> 00:03:50,220
They're charged separately for capacity--

78
00:03:50,220 --> 00:03:53,920
that is, the maximum amount of power
they're allowed to draw at any time--

79
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:56,090
than for average bulk power of electricity

80
00:03:56,090 --> 00:03:58,680
because there are really
two services you're getting.

81
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:00,740
You're getting the total
number of kilowatt hours

82
00:04:00,740 --> 00:04:04,090
and you're getting the ability to
get a certain number of kilowatts

83
00:04:04,090 --> 00:04:07,530
any time you want it and both
those things are valuable.

84
00:04:07,530 --> 00:04:11,650
So the engineer or economists answer
is that when a small business or home

85
00:04:11,650 --> 00:04:13,740
supplies power whenever
they want to, whatever

86
00:04:13,740 --> 00:04:16,680
they have access to the grid,
the price they should get

87
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:20,760
is the system's current bulk power
price, not their net metering price.

88
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:23,750
So in that sense, net metering is a subsidy.

89
00:04:23,750 --> 00:04:26,880
Now, that subsidy may make sense if
there are social reasons that we want

90
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:28,950
to subsidize distributed generation.

91
00:04:28,950 --> 00:04:31,890
For example, because we want
to put solar power on roofs,

92
00:04:31,890 --> 00:04:35,000
but we need to be clear it is a subsidy.
