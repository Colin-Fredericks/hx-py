DAVID KEITH: electricity system--
the electric power grid is one

1
00:00:04,170 --> 00:00:06,540
of humanity's most amazing inventions.

2
00:00:06,540 --> 00:00:09,590
For example, when the US
National Academy of Engineering

3
00:00:09,590 --> 00:00:13,210
ranked the most important
inventions of the 20th century,

4
00:00:13,210 --> 00:00:16,840
number one on that list was
the electric power system.

5
00:00:16,840 --> 00:00:22,280
This next list of roughly 10 facts
defines how that system works today.

6
00:00:22,280 --> 00:00:25,110
These are not, in fact, all
exactly facts, as we'll discover,

7
00:00:25,110 --> 00:00:28,780
but they are a very good approximation
to the way the electricity system now

8
00:00:28,780 --> 00:00:30,050
works.

9
00:00:30,050 --> 00:00:33,270
First, it is a dense
interconnected network going

10
00:00:33,270 --> 00:00:36,000
between generators and final consumers.

11
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,150
Second, there's no storage.

12
00:00:38,150 --> 00:00:43,810
To a very good approximation, supply and
demand must be instantaneously matched.

13
00:00:43,810 --> 00:00:46,480
In the United States,
for example, the capacity

14
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:49,130
flowing in and out of all
the combined storage systems

15
00:00:49,130 --> 00:00:54,000
is about 50 times smaller than the peak
capacity to generate power on the grid.

16
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,420
Third, demand is unresponsive.

17
00:00:56,420 --> 00:01:00,270
In the short term, demand
does not respond to price.

18
00:01:00,270 --> 00:01:02,870
This means that electric
power operators work

19
00:01:02,870 --> 00:01:07,090
by forecasting demand, building the
capacity, generators and transmission

20
00:01:07,090 --> 00:01:10,380
systems they need to meet that
demand, and then operating

21
00:01:10,380 --> 00:01:13,310
the system in real time to match demand.

22
00:01:13,310 --> 00:01:17,140
And that means in real time down
to the second to match demand.

23
00:01:17,140 --> 00:01:20,470
Fourth, alternating power grids are dynamic.

24
00:01:20,470 --> 00:01:24,510
They're dynamic beasts with
both elasticity and inertia

25
00:01:24,510 --> 00:01:27,590
and that elasticity and inertia that
comes both from mechanical systems

26
00:01:27,590 --> 00:01:29,900
and electromagnetic systems combines to make

27
00:01:29,900 --> 00:01:32,370
instability, oscillations, oscillations that

28
00:01:32,370 --> 00:01:34,620
could potentially break the system.

29
00:01:34,620 --> 00:01:38,060
This is completely unlike the flow
of data in the internet, where

30
00:01:38,060 --> 00:01:40,620
we can direct exactly where
it goes, or for that matter,

31
00:01:40,620 --> 00:01:43,650
the flow of water in pipes or
natural gas in the gas system.

32
00:01:43,650 --> 00:01:48,230
It is a dynamic system unlike any
other and much harder to control.

33
00:01:48,230 --> 00:01:53,120
It's important to note that the AC
power grid is not one single world grid.

34
00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:55,340
In North America, for
example, there are actually

35
00:01:55,340 --> 00:02:00,640
four independent, synchronous
alternating current grids, east, west,

36
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:02,120
Texas, and Quebec.

37
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:06,260
Each of these operates at 60 hertz
but are independently synchronized.

38
00:02:06,260 --> 00:02:10,080
And you can only flow power in
between them with direct current.

39
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:14,020
Fifth, electricity is in many
senses a natural monopoly.

40
00:02:14,020 --> 00:02:17,080
The very tight coupling
between supply and demand

41
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:20,760
and the ease in which large suppliers
can gain what's called market power

42
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:24,290
makes it very hard to have the
traditional free market mechanisms

43
00:02:24,290 --> 00:02:26,150
we see in other parts of the economy.

44
00:02:26,150 --> 00:02:29,720
Sixth, the electrification
of the global energy system

45
00:02:29,720 --> 00:02:31,840
has increased steadily over the last century

46
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:35,730
and it's a very good bet that this trend
will continue over the 21st century.

47
00:02:35,730 --> 00:02:38,160
The reason is that from the
point of view of a consumer,

48
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:40,930
whether an individual consumer
or industry, electricity

49
00:02:40,930 --> 00:02:46,440
is such a fantastic energy carrier,
high-powered, controllable, efficient,

50
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:48,320
and nonpolluting at point of use.

51
00:02:48,320 --> 00:02:51,150
These factors mean that
consumers and industry

52
00:02:51,150 --> 00:02:53,630
will keep using more
electricity as a fraction

53
00:02:53,630 --> 00:02:56,190
of total energy over the next century.

54
00:02:56,190 --> 00:03:01,510
Seventh, right of access-- electricity
is such a necessity for modern life

55
00:03:01,510 --> 00:03:04,270
that we treat it differently
from many other commodities.

56
00:03:04,270 --> 00:03:07,080
If, for example, you don't
pay your bill to Amazon,

57
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:11,140
Amazon is free in a free market
to stop sending you packages.

58
00:03:11,140 --> 00:03:12,640
Electricity is different.

59
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:14,840
We regulate it as one of
the necessities and we

60
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:19,540
make it much harder for an electricity
utility to cut off your power

61
00:03:19,540 --> 00:03:21,040
if you don't pay your bill.

62
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:24,700
Eighth, the electricity system
depends on a stock of infrastructure,

63
00:03:24,700 --> 00:03:28,100
of capital built up over
decades and decades.

64
00:03:28,100 --> 00:03:32,260
In the US, for example, more than half
of the generating capacity in the US

65
00:03:32,260 --> 00:03:35,970
is greater than 30 years old and
more than 2/3 of the power poles

66
00:03:35,970 --> 00:03:38,280
are also more than 30 years old.

67
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:40,830
Ninth, electricity
transmission and distribution

68
00:03:40,830 --> 00:03:43,040
is extraordinarily efficient.

69
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:49,800
In the United States, the system is 94%
efficient and the global average is 92%

70
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:53,240
So globally, only 8% of
electricity generated

71
00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:55,670
is lost in the transmission
and distribution system.

72
00:03:55,670 --> 00:03:58,020
It's an amazing feat of engineering.

73
00:03:58,020 --> 00:04:02,050
10th and finally, the system
is amazingly reliable.

74
00:04:02,050 --> 00:04:06,550
In the United States, consumers
get power more than 99.95%

75
00:04:06,550 --> 00:04:11,200
of the time and those outages are mostly
local, where, for example, a tree falls

76
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:12,759
on a distribution pole.

77
00:04:12,759 --> 00:04:14,800
The amount of time that
the whole grid goes down,

78
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:18,970
that we have interconnected failures,
is extraordinarily infrequent.

79
00:04:18,970 --> 00:04:22,840
Those failures have happened only
once every few decades, on average.

80
00:04:22,840 --> 00:04:25,320
These 10 "facts" should
shape your understanding

81
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:26,900
of the electricity system.

82
00:04:26,900 --> 00:04:29,550
But of course, not all of
these are strictly true.

83
00:04:29,550 --> 00:04:31,801
The first four particularly
are subject to change

84
00:04:31,801 --> 00:04:34,050
and we'll talk about them
in the rest of this section.

85
00:04:34,050 --> 00:04:37,600
Here's a short walk through a
modern electric power system.

86
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:42,970
Generators, almost all of which are
turbines, steam, gas, water, or wind,

87
00:04:42,970 --> 00:04:48,110
turn synchronous three-phase
alternating generators that make power.

88
00:04:48,110 --> 00:04:52,680
Transformers then turn that power
from high-current low-voltage

89
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:54,730
to high-voltage low-current.

90
00:04:54,730 --> 00:04:59,650
The power is moved then by high-voltage
long-distance transmission lines

91
00:04:59,650 --> 00:05:01,760
where other transformers turn it back down

92
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:04,270
to lower-voltage higher-current power, which

93
00:05:04,270 --> 00:05:06,660
is distributed in intermediate lines.

94
00:05:06,660 --> 00:05:09,550
And then finally, still
other sets of transformers

95
00:05:09,550 --> 00:05:13,570
turn it into lower-voltage power which
goes through final distribution lines

96
00:05:13,570 --> 00:05:15,420
to the end users.

97
00:05:15,420 --> 00:05:17,200
Why the high voltage?

98
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:19,680
Power is voltage times current.

99
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:23,390
Suppose you wanted to transmit
one gigawatt of power.

100
00:05:23,390 --> 00:05:29,740
You could do that using one gigavolt and
one amp or using one giga-amp and one

101
00:05:29,740 --> 00:05:32,970
volt. Either of those
would transmit a gigawatt.

102
00:05:32,970 --> 00:05:37,920
But the loss of power in a conductive
line, like a transmission line,

103
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:43,120
is proportional to I-squared R, the
current squared times the resistance.

104
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:47,390
So if you double the current, you
lose four times as much power.

105
00:05:47,390 --> 00:05:50,380
This puts a big premium
on running the systems

106
00:05:50,380 --> 00:05:53,660
at low current and low
current means high voltage

107
00:05:53,660 --> 00:05:55,410
for a given amount of power.

108
00:05:55,410 --> 00:05:58,830
So in practice, we run at
higher and higher voltages

109
00:05:58,830 --> 00:06:02,600
when we want to transmit power a long
way because that allows us to transmit

110
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:04,790
power long distances efficiently.

111
00:06:04,790 --> 00:06:07,340
Well, you can't directly give
consumers the high voltages

112
00:06:07,340 --> 00:06:08,710
we use for transmission.

113
00:06:08,710 --> 00:06:12,060
You'd kill them or blow things
up or in a more pragmatic note,

114
00:06:12,060 --> 00:06:14,000
you'd have to use very thick insulators.

115
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:17,340
So we need ways in the system to
go between the high voltages we

116
00:06:17,340 --> 00:06:20,700
use for transmission to lower voltages
that we use to actually distribute

117
00:06:20,700 --> 00:06:23,300
power to final consumers.

118
00:06:23,300 --> 00:06:27,210
With alternating current,
you can use a transformer.

119
00:06:27,210 --> 00:06:31,130
A transformer allows you to go
between high-current low-voltage

120
00:06:31,130 --> 00:06:33,910
to high-voltage low-current or vice versa.

121
00:06:33,910 --> 00:06:37,960
And it does this using technology that
actually is 19th-century technology.

122
00:06:37,960 --> 00:06:40,980
They have no moving parts,
they're easy to build,

123
00:06:40,980 --> 00:06:43,920
and large transformers can
be extraordinarily efficient,

124
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:46,370
more than 98% efficient.

125
00:06:46,370 --> 00:06:49,250
It's the transformer that
works only on AC power,

126
00:06:49,250 --> 00:06:54,330
not DC, that is the ultimate
reason that we have AC power grids.
